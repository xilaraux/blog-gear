A formidable predator, the gray wolf can grow to be 7 feet long from nose to tail and weigh up to 175 pounds. This canine is known to be extremely social and intelligent, living and hunting in packs that vary in size relative to the abundance and size of prey. The gray wolf hunts on the tundra, steppes and woodlands of Europe, Asia and North America. Despite their name, gray wolves vary in color from white in the arctic to yellowish brown to near black farther south. Larger packs form where there are many large ungulates such elk and moose. In Alaska, packs as large as 30 individuals have been documented. The social hierarchy of a pack is well established and constantly reinforced through gestures and postures. The dominant individual, or alpha wolf, signals its status by carrying its tail higher than other pack mates.

                "content": "As the largest land animal, the African bush elephant reaches up to 24 feet in length and 13 feet in height. Also known as the African savanna elephant, it is found in most African countries, living in varied habitats from the open savanna to the desert and high rainforest. It is the largest of the three elephant species and can weigh up to 11 tons and live up to 70 years, longer than any other mammal except humans. African bush elephants are herbivores and need to eat about 350 pounds of vegetation daily. In addition to two prominent tusks, which are present in both sexes, the elephant is characterized by its two large ears, pillarlike legs, thickset body and a large head with a muscular, mobile trunk. The trunk is a strong appendage, with more than 40,000 muscles and tendons. Its sensitive tip ends in two finger-like projections, which can manipulate small objects. The trunk can lift objects of more than 400 pounds. Water is sucked up through the trunk and then blown into the mouth for a drink or onto the back as a cooling mist. Elephant herds consist of related females and their young, and are managed by the eldest female, called the matriarch. The adult male elephant rarely joins a herd and leads a solitary life, only approaching herds during mating season. Females give birth to a single calf after 22 months of gestation, the longest gestation period among mammals. Because elephants require substantial amounts of food and a large area in which to forage, habitat destruction across their range is a major threat to survival. As of late, poaching has caused the most serious damage to African bush elephant populations, with approximately 25,000 being lost every year.

It is one of North America’s largest reptiles, growing as long as 18 feet. The American alligator can be distinguished from its relative the American crocodile by its round snout, darker color and the absence of visible teeth when the mouth is closed. A remarkably well-adapted aquatic hunter, juvenile alligators prey on insects, small fish and frogs. As adults, they add larger prey like turtles, small mammals, birds, juvenile alligators, and have been known to take animals as large as deer. Despite its propensity for cannibalism, the alligator does care for its young. After a surprising slow and tender courtship, females build a mound nest, lay 25-52 eggs, let them incubate for approximately 65 days, then free the hatchlings when they cry to her. Young may remain with the mother as long as three years. If they survive the dangerous juvenile years, alligators may live as long as 35-50 years in the wild. In the 20th century, humans nearly accomplished what 65 millions of nature couldn’t: the extinction of the American alligator.

Well, with trigger hairs. When two hairs are touched within 20 seconds of each other, or if a single hair is touched twice, the trap snaps shut. Healthier Venus Flytraps close quicker. Scientists are unsure about the mechanism; it has to do with neighboring cells sending chemical messages to each other.
